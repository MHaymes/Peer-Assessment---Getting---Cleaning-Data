The following files are included in this repo: 

* run_analysis.R:  Manipulates the raw UCI-HAR dataset to produce two tidy data sets.  The first is a tidy dataset containing the mean and standard deviations of feature variables.  The second produces a dataset of average values for each variable, for each unique subject/activity identifier pair. 

* Readme.md:  Additional information on running the R script and required packages.

ABOUT THE DATA
==============

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.


Data Transformations
===============

The following transformations are applied to the original HAR dataset by running the run_analysis.R script: 
1) The activity variables contained in Y_Train.txt, subject_test.txt and X_test are combined to form a single dataset.  An identical procedure is applied to the X_test, Y_test and subject_test dataset files.  
2) The resulting two datasets are appended together to to form a single dataset containing all activities, subjects, and features.   
3) Labels were applied to activity functions and variable names using information contained in the activity_labels.txt and features.txt files, respectively.  
4) The mean and standard deviation variables are extracted to form a single tidy data set, labelled HAR-tidy.txt, which is outputted ot the root directory.  
5) A second dataset is created, titled HAR-Averages.txt, which contains the average values of each variable for each unique activity/subject pair.


Features
==========
The Mean and Standard Deviation are produced for the following variables.  


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
