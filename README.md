Peer Assessment - Getting &amp; Cleaning Data

Instructions for use: 

Download zipped data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The entire UCI - HAR folder should be unzipped to your local R working directory (not the individual files).  The R script contains several functions; however, these are all called internally by the main run_analysis() function.  Calling this function will create the two output datafiles within the working directory.
